{"Title": "Hegseth orders pause in US cyber-offensive against Russia", "DateAndTime": "3 March 2025", "ExtractedInformation": "The halt of American cyber operations against Russia came from Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth in new guidance to US Cyber Command, officials told the BBC's US partner CBS News.\n\nIt leaves questions over the strength of the US fightback in the cyber arena against alleged Russian hacking, election interference and sabotage efforts that have targeted the Western nations which have sided with Ukraine during the war.\n\nHundreds or thousands of personnel could be affected by Hegseth's order, according to The Record, a cybersecurity publication which first reported the news, external. Operations aimed at strengthening Ukraine's digital defences are likely to be among those affected.\n\nIn a statement, a senior defence department official said they would not comment on the issue due to operation concerns, but added: \"There is no greater priority to Secretary Hegseth than the safety of the Warfighter in all operations, to include the cyber domain.\"\n\nNational Security Adviser Mike Waltz denied that a policy change had been discussed, but acknowledged in an interview on CNN that there would be \"all kinds of carrots and sticks to get this war to an end\".\n\nSenior members of Trump's team - who last month met their Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia, with the Ukrainians excluded - have recently defended their change of approach to Moscow more broadly.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio told ABC: \"You're not going to bring [the Russians] to the table if you're calling them names, if you're being antagonistic. That's just the president's instincts from years and years and years of putting together deals.\"\n\nIn a statement to the New York Times, senior Democrat Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said the move was \"a critical strategic mistake\".\n\nTrump seemed to be giving Putin \"a free pass as Russia continues to launch cyberoperations and ransomware attacks against critical American infrastructure\", Schumer added."},
